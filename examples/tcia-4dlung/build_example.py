"""Build an Open-H-4D submission from the TCIA 4D-Lung release.

**This archive is already NIfTI, not DICOM.** It holds eight subjects, each a
directory of ten respiratory-gated 3D volumes named ``<subject>_g000.nii.gz``
through ``<subject>_g090.nii.gz`` -- the 0% through 90% gates of one breathing
cycle. So this example covers the path a contributor takes when their data
never went through a PACS, or came back from a research pipeline as NIfTI:
re-identify, restructure, and describe. It does not exercise dcm2niix; the
synthetic example does that.

The interesting work here is the phase labels. ``g040`` means the 40% gate, and
that fraction is the only record of where in the breathing cycle each volume
sits. Dropping it would leave ten volumes in an arbitrary order.

    python examples/tcia-4dlung/build_example.py --out /tmp/oh4d-lung --max-patients 1

Downloads roughly 2 GB on first run and caches it, so re-runs are fast.

# Open-H-4D -- TCIA 4D-Lung (Part 1)

Respiratory-gated 4D CT of the thorax, restructured into the Open-H-4D
submission layout from the `TCIA-4DLung-Part1.zip` release asset published by
[Project-MONAI/monai-physio](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-physio).

## Dataset Description

{n_patients} subject(s), {n_studies} 4D study(ies), {n_timepoints} time points in
total. Each study is one breathing cycle sampled at ten evenly spaced
respiratory gates, 0% through 90%, where 0% is end-inhalation.

The source data are lung cancer patients imaged for radiotherapy treatment
planning, which is why the acquisitions are 4D: the treatment plan has to
account for tumour motion with respiration.

## Dataset Contributor(s)

Restructured by the Open-H-4D tooling from a public release. Original
acquisition: see the citation below.

## Dataset Creation Date

See the upstream TCIA collection; the Open-H-4D restructuring adds no dates.

## License / Terms of Use

CC BY 4.0, inherited from the upstream TCIA collection.

## Intended Usage

Training and validating models of respiratory motion; a worked example of the
Open-H-4D layout for contributors whose data is already NIfTI.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** clinical
- **Labeling Method:** N/A (no annotations in this release)
- **Acquisition system:** 4D CT, respiratory-gated

## Dataset Format

Open-H-4D submission layout: one 4D study per directory, one `t####.nii.gz` per
respiratory gate, with the source gate recorded as each time point's
`phase_label` and `phase_fraction`.

## Dataset Quantification

- Subjects: {n_patients}
- Studies: {n_studies}
- Time points: {n_timepoints}

## Subject Metadata

Not published with this release. `patient.json` records only what is known:
the de-identification status and the reason for scan. Age, sex, disease state
and vitals are absent upstream and are left null rather than guessed.

## Data Validation

`python -m openh4d.verify_layout <root>` reports `compliant: true`.
`python -m openh4d.motion_report <study-dir>` shows diaphragm motion across the
ten gates.

## Known Issues

Subject-level clinical metadata is not available, so the `patient.json` files
are sparse. A real Open-H-4D submission is expected to populate them.

## Ethical Considerations

The upstream collection is publicly released and de-identified. The Open-H-4D
identifiers (`{prefix}-NNNN`) are assigned locally and do not encode the
upstream subject identifiers.
