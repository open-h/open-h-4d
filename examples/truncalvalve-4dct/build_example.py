"""Build an Open-H-4D submission from a 3D Slicer 4D sequence NRRD.

The source is one file: ``TruncalValve_4DCT.seq.nrrd``, a cardiac-gated 4D CT of
a truncal valve written by 3D Slicer as a sequence. This is the path a
contributor takes when their 4D data lives in a research tool's own format
rather than in DICOM.

Two properties of that file are what make this example worth having, and both
are silent failures if handled wrongly:

* **Time comes first.** The header reads ``sizes: 21 512 391 218`` with
  ``kinds: list domain domain domain`` -- 21 time points of a 512x391x218
  volume. SimpleITK surfaces that leading axis as vector components on a 3D
  image, not as a fourth dimension.
* **The handedness flips.** The file declares ``space: right-anterior-superior``;
  SimpleITK normalizes to LPS on read; NIfTI wants RAS. Getting the flip wrong
  mirrors the anatomy and raises nothing at all.

Both are handled in :mod:`openh4d.convert_nrrd`, and this example is the
end-to-end check that they stay handled.

# Open-H-4D -- Truncal Valve 4D CT

A cardiac-gated 4D CT of a truncal valve, restructured into the Open-H-4D
submission layout from the `TruncalValve_4DCT.seq.nrrd` release asset published
by [Project-MONAI/monai-physio](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/monai-physio).

## Dataset Description

One subject, one 4D study, {n_timepoints} time points spanning the cardiac
cycle. The source is a 3D Slicer sequence: a single NRRD whose leading axis is
time.

## Dataset Contributor(s)

Restructured by the Open-H-4D tooling from a public release.

## License / Terms of Use

CC BY 4.0, inherited from the upstream release.

## Intended Usage

Modelling cardiac valve motion; a worked example of the Open-H-4D layout for
contributors whose data is in a research tool's own format rather than DICOM.

## Dataset Characterization

- **Data Collection Method:** clinical
- **Labeling Method:** N/A (no annotations in this release)
- **Acquisition system:** cardiac-gated 4D CT, {in_plane} mm in plane,
  {slice_spacing} mm slices

## Dataset Format

Open-H-4D submission layout: one `t####.nii.gz` per cardiac phase, converted
from the Slicer sequence with SimpleITK. The source declares RAS; the written
NIfTI affines carry that geometry through unchanged, with no resampling.

## Dataset Quantification

- Subjects: 1
- Studies: 1
- Time points: {n_timepoints}
- Matrix: {matrix}

## Subject Metadata

Not published with this release. `patient.json` records the de-identification
status and the reason for scan; demographics and vitals are absent upstream and
are left null rather than guessed.

## Data Validation

`python -m openh4d.verify_layout <root>` reports `compliant: true`.
`python -m openh4d.motion_report <study-dir>` measures the valve motion across
the cardiac cycle; peak centre-of-mass travel for this study is
{peak_travel} voxels.

**Orientation check.** Open `t0000.nii.gz` alongside the original
`.seq.nrrd` in 3D Slicer and confirm they overlay. No unit test substitutes for
this: a wrong handedness flip mirrors the anatomy without raising anything.

## Known Issues

Subject-level clinical metadata is not available upstream, so `patient.json` is
sparse. A real Open-H-4D submission is expected to populate it.

## Ethical Considerations

The upstream release is public and de-identified. The Open-H-4D identifier is
assigned locally.
