"""Measure whether a 4D study actually contains motion, and what kind.

This is the check unique to a 4D initiative. Everything else Open-H-4D verifies
would be just as true of a pile of 3D scans: the naming, the schemas, the
resolution thresholds. None of them notice a study where two "time points" are
the same volume copied twice, or where the phase sort collapsed, or where the
sequence never spans systole.

The division of labour is deliberate. This module emits **numbers**: a
displacement curve, a per-time-point intensity curve, duplicate detection, the
phase-label ordering. Whether the motion those numbers describe is physiologic
or an artefact is a judgement, and that belongs to the imaging physicist persona
in the submission evaluation, not to a threshold in here. The one thing the code
does assert is the case with no judgement in it: two time points that are
byte-for-byte identical are not two time points.
