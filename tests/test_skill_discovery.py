"""Every skill in ``skills/`` must be discoverable by Claude Code.

Claude Code reads project skills from exactly ``<repo>/.claude/skills`` and its
loader drops any entry that is neither a directory nor a symlink. On native
Windows without Developer Mode, git materializes a committed symlink as a plain
text file -- so a skill silently disappears with no error anywhere. That is the
failure this test exists to catch; ``scripts/bootstrap_skills.py`` is the fix.
